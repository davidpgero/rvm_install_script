The short rvm (ruby version manager) install script.

How install?

- git clone git://github.com/davidpgero/rvm_install_script.git
- cd rvm_install_script
- chmod +x rvm_install_script.sh
- ./rvm_install_script.sh

After the last steps you go to coffee. Hopefully after the install you get the message about your ruby version is 1.9.2 and install the Ruby Version Manager.

How it's works?

- install rvm and add your .bashrc
- install package (readline, iconv, zlib, openssl, autoconf)
- install ruby 1.9.2 with above package
- settings the ruby 1.9.2 the default
- testing the ruby version. If you get the 1.9.2 - It's work!
