The short rvm (ruby version manager) install script.

How it's works?

- install rvm and add your .bashrc
- install package (readline, iconv, zlib, openssl, autoconf)
- install ruby 1.9.2 with above package
- settings the ruby 1.9.2 the default
- testing the ruby version. If you get the 1.9.2 - It's work!
